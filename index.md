I am a Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt University. I am double affiliated to Civil and Environmental Engineering ([CEE](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/civil-environmental-engineering/)) and the Institute for Software Integrated Systems ([VU-ISIS](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/)). I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Dan Work](https://lab-work.github.io/about/).

My research interest centers around the two-fold challenges of emerging technologies in real-world transportation systems: algorithms and deployments. In detail:
- How can we design algorithms that are reliable and compliant to domain specifications in traffic signal systems?
- How can we integrate AI in infrastructure hardware in a scalable manner?
