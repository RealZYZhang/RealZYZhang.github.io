Happy to share that I am awarded a Russell G. Hamilton Graduate Leadership Institute **Professional Development and Training Grant** from Vanderbilt Graduate School! This is a highly selective grant in support for graduate students seeking non-credit bearing professional development and training opportunities to further develop their academic and professional skills. Only 14 applicants were selected during 2024-2025 academic year among all graduate students.

I am supported to attend **ITS World Congress** 2025 in Atlanta, GA, during Aug 24-27. [ITS World Congress](https://www.itsamericaevents.com/world-congress/en-us.html#/) is a premier industrial event that brings together world leaders, practitioners, policy makers, researchers, and private industry to advance and unite the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) industry. I am hoping to connect to more industrial professionals and learn about advanced practices of ITS deployment worldwide. See you in Atlanta!
